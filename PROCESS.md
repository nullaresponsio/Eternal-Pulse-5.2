### Step-by-Step Changes:
We are going to upgrade the scanner.py with the following enhancements:
 1. Add more debug logging at least every 10 seconds to show what the scanner is doing in real-time.
 2. Remove any garbage code (unused variables, functions, or classes) to improve performance and readability.
 3. Enhance the AI predictor with more vulnerability patterns and improve the model weights.
 4. Improve the EvasionEngine with more techniques and better logging.
 5. Extend the StatefulFuzzer with more illegal state transitions and better state management.
 6. Add more fuzzing techniques to the GeneticFuzzer and improve crash triage.
 7. Improve the KernelHeapGroomer with more patterns and better resource management.
 8. Enhance the vulnerability detection methods with more checks and better accuracy.
 9. Optimize the scanning process to handle more targets and reduce false positives.
10. Add more detailed status logging and progress reporting.
